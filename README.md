PLS-based Gene Subset Augmentation and Identification of Gene Subsets Specific to Tumors
==================================
Our algorithms can identify differentially expressed genes as well as genes with a weakly differentially expressed signal. Meanwhile, it can identify a series of different gene subsets that are small in size but strong in overall discriminative power. In contrast to the conventional method that can only obtain a single specific gene subset, our proposed algorithm can identify a series of different gene subsets and their weakly differentially expressed genes, which helps to elucidate the molecular characteristics of tumor diseases and specific expression patterns of tumor genes.
